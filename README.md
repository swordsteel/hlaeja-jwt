# Hl√¶ja Common Messages

In quiet chambers of learning, where minds are aglow, A ledger of endorsements, the authenticity to bestow. Each certificate approved, with scrutiny and might, Their legitimacy confirmed, in the light of day and night. From manuscripts to databases, knowledge is refined, Librarians and experts, their judgment to define. The Approval Archive, a sacred trust to hold, A testament to credentials, where merit is told.

## Properties

The following properties can be used to configure the deployment of your application. If specified, these properties will load their respective services.

| name            | info                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| jwt.private-key | Location of the private key file. If specified, the `PrivateJwtService` will be loaded with the provided private key for signing purposes.           |
| jwt.public-key  | Location of the public key file. If specified, the `PublicJwtService` service will be loaded with the provided public key for verification purposes. |

**Note:** The `jwt.private-key` and `jwt.public-key` properties are optional and correspond to separate services: `PrivateJwtService` and `PublicJwtService`, respectively. If either property is specified, its corresponding service will be loaded. For example:

- Specifying only `jwt.private-key` will load the `PrivateJwtService` for signing purposes.
- Specifying only `jwt.public-key` will load the `PublicJwtService` for verification purposes.
- Specifying both properties will enable both services, allowing for full JWT functionality with authentication and authorization.
